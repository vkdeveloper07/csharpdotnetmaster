            <h2>Four pillars of Object oriented programming.</h2>
        </div>
        <p>In this section , let's understand the four pillars of object oriented programming.</p>
        <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">Abstraction</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Inheritance</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Polymorphism</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Encapsulation</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="well">
            <h2>Abstraction</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            Abstraction , also called data hiding,  stands for showing only essential details to the user , hiding
            unnecessary details of which user is not concerned about.Take the example of DVD player. You only have the buttons
            visible outside for various functions like power on , next previous etc. But the how these buttons work actually
            inside the box is hidden from you.
        </p>
        <div class="well">
            <h2>Inheritance</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            Inheritance as the name suggest, stands for deriving or inheriting properties of parent class into child classes.
            In C#, there are four types of inheritance
            <ul>
                <li>Single Inheritance- Only one child class inherits properties of parent class.</li>

                <li>
                    Multilevel Inheritance- In this inheritance, a subclass inherits parent class and similarly it becomes parent class for
                    other child classes.
                </li>
                <img src="../Images/multilevel-inheritance.JPG" alt="MultiLevel Inheritance" />
                <li>
                    Multiple Inheritance- Multiple inheritance in c# is achieved via interfaces.

                </li>

                <li>
                    Hirarchical Inheritance- In this type of inheritance , multiple child classes inherit from only one parent
                    class.

                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <div class="well">
            <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            Polymorphism stands for ability of an object to take many forms. Depending on the class , the object can behave
            in many ways. The best example is method overloading and method overriding.It means defining the method
            having same syntax in both parent and child class but behvior is accoding to the respective classes.
        </p>
        <div class="well">
            <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping up data and object into single unit. The best example is class. We define
            all object, properties methods and fields into a class. It also provides security as we can declare our members of class
            as private, making it invisible from rest of the world.
