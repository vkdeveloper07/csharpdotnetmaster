            <h2>Introduction To .NET</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            .NET is software development framework developed by Microsoft. It runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It is a collection
            of large class library which provides services like interoperability. .NET framework can be used to develop both windows
            based on web based applications.We can also use .NET framework to develop applications in various programming languages
            like c#,F# Visual Basic etc.
        </p>

        <div class="well">
            <h2>.NET framework componants</h2>
        </div>
        <h3>1.Common language runtime -</h3>
        <p>
            The Common Language Runtime (CLR) is a execution environment for programs written
            using .NET framework.The CLR provides many services like memory managment,garbage collection,type safety,exception
            handling and Thread managment. The programs written using .NET framework are compiled by CLR instead of directly
            compiled into machine code.During execution of programs, the Just In Time (JIT) compiler converts CLR code into machine code.
        </p>
        <h3>2. CLass Library-</h3>
        <p>
            The .NET framework also includes the set of class libraries.Class library is a set of functions and methods
            that can be used in programs written using .NET framewok. These methods are collected into various namespaces
            like System, System.Threading,System.IO etc. These namespaces can be used in programs with <q>using</q> keyword
            For ex- <code>using System;</code>
        </p>
        <h3>3. Types of applications-</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                WinForms- .NET framework can be used for developing Windows based application. These types of applications
                runs on windows machine only. For ex- Notepad
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Asp.NET- These types of applications are web based applications. These application are run with the help of
                browsers.In web based applications , the Client-Server architecture is followed. The program runs on server
                for ex- IIS server and the client machine connect with server and request for specific files or content. The
                server serves the requested content to those clients.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                ADO.NET- The aplications often needs to store user data or any other data in database. This technology is
                used to interact with the database. The programs can use ADO.NET to connect and store data to databases like
                Microsoft SQL server , Oracle, MSSQL etc
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="well">
            <h2>.NET Design Principle</h2>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Interoperability- This is very important design principle of .NET. The applications developed on various
                version of .NET are compatible to each other. Also the programs developed on different platform are also accessible
                to .NET with the help of namespaces <code>System.Runtime.InteropServices</code> and <code>System.EnterpriseServices</code>
            </li><br />
            <li>Portability- Earlier with .NET framework the application written in .NET were available to Microsoft Windows
            only. But with the development of .NET core the applicatios will be available to Mac and linux. </li><br />
            <li>Security- The .NET framework provides very good inbuilt security.It takes care of the varification and
            validation of programs and applications. The applications can also implement their own explicit security 
            mechanism.</li><br />
            <li>Memory Management- The .NET framework is very good at it's memory management. The CLR check to see which 
            resource are not being used. It then release those resources to free up the memory space. This is done by 
            a componant called <b>garbage collector</b> and the mechansm is called <b>garbage collection</b>.</li><br />
            <li>Type Safety- is another design principle. The .NET framework restricts users to do improper casts, ill-defined
                datatypes and variables. It also introduced static and dynamic types data types which check the datatype at compiler 
            and run time.</li>
        </ul>
